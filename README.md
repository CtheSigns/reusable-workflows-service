GitHub Actions reusable workflows for backend services

:exclamation: be aware this is public repo (due to requirements on reusing workflows from another repo) hence avoid committing to it any sensitive data. </br>
For more details on how to reuse the workflows pls follow to [GitHub Actions Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)

## Versioning
* You should reuse only workflows only by release git tags. Tags with their versions and releases created automatically using https://github.com/mathieudutour/github-tag-action.
* It highly recommended following commit message convention for creating right versions automatically. See https://github.com/mathieudutour/github-tag-action#bumping
